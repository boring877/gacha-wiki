		Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
	</p>

	<p>
		This site is built by someone who's probably spent way too much time (and maybe money) on gacha games. Started as a personal project to keep track of my favorite games and share tips with friends, it's grown into something bigger.
	</p>

	<h2>What you'll find here:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>ðŸŽ® Guides written by actual players who understand the struggle</li>
		<li>ðŸ’Ž Tips for enjoying games without breaking the bank</li>
		<li>ðŸŽ¯ Character analyses and team recommendations</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Remember: It's all about having fun! Whether you're F2P, a dolphin, or a whale, you're welcome here.
	</p>
