Freya possesses infinite magical power like an abyss within her body. This not only grants her keen magical perception talent, but she only needs to casually wave the spell scepter [Gulveig] in her hands to unleash powerful magic that other gifted students have cultivated.",

What she has always pursued is using her powerful abilities to protect the family. After rebirth from catastrophe, she developed the idea of becoming the family's support. She collected and studied many strange and mysterious spells, rebuilt the family mansion, and silently worked for the glory that once experienced divine wandering.",
