      "Introduction: Sigurd - [Lord of the Underworld] One of Hela's servants, she was once bathed in dragon blood and possesses near-immortal defensive abilities. Frigga's adopted daughter, she also lives in [Asar Manor]. She is proud of her inherited heroic bloodline, sometimes to the point of being overly arrogant, but she is actually softhearted and easily hurt, and very kind. She doesn't want to be hurt, so she always adopts a defensive posture, speaking with pride while saying things she doesn't mean. Loki jokingly calls her \"the misunderstood fake heiress.\" She deeply values the members of the manor and would sacrifice herself to protect her family.",

      'Introduction: As you are reading documents, you hear a soft whisper behind you. "Christmas...what do you want?" Turning around, you see her striking a seductive pose, reclining on the bed, her posture languid and alluring. Her once spirited eyes are now gazing at you like melting honey. The rose in her vibrant under the lamplight, is no longer just an everyday decoration, but the perfect finishing touch to a gift box, signifying its uniqueness. Undoubtedly, on this cold winter night, no gift could be more touching than this surprise filled with love and warmth. You slowly walk towards her; it seems tonight will be more passionate than any other winter night before.',
