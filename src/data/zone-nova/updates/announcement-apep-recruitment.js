      "Apep is a Wind-attribute Striker character. The scythe in her hands has harvested countless enemies. On the battlefield, she fights like a fearless war machine that decimates foes. Every time enemies think they can compensate for the difference in combat power with numbers, they instead fall into Apep's trap, because... Apep's greatest strength is her sustained combat ability...",

      "Apep — An ancient evil god who has existed since the beginning of the world's creation. Together with her twin sister [Ra], they are witnesses to the birth of the world. In the records of the gods, Ra is revered by all things for her diligence and radiance, while Apep has long been neglected due to her gloomy personality. Even the younger gods born later deliberately avoided her existence. The isolated Apep could only wander alone to the ends of the world — that forbidden land filled with evil and chaos, where she unexpectedly gained the worship and faith of the wicked who were cast out by the world.",
