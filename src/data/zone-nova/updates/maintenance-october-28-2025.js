      'Introduction: Today\'s Nini looks drastically different from her usual cold, stern self. Her blue long hair sways gently in the night breeze, and she wears a pair of fluffy cat ears, making her appear awkward. On the dim, quiet street, the glow of streetlights wraps around her in a faint halo. Most strikingly, she is wearing sensual lingerie—an extreme contrast to her typically rational image. She tightly clutches a pumpkin-shaped candy bucket filled with colorful candies. Her cheeks flush, her expression shy, and her eyes dart nervously as she raises her head to look at the camera. It\'s clear she lost a bet in the game and was forced to wear this heart-pounding outfit, then went door-to-door for treats. The photo captures the moment she pushes open a door, lips slightly parted as if to say "Trick or Treat," but shyness turns it into a weak breath. In the cold night, her usual coldness mixes with this awkwardness—a rare sight. Is the "candy" she\'s obsessed with really just… candy?',

      'Introduction: Suo\'er is one of the "Queen\'s Vassals" and a key pillar of the "Aesir Clan," serving as the guardian of the "Mist Forest." She wields thunderous power, holds the massive hammer "Myonir," and fights alongside the goddess of war. With辉煌战绩 including single-handedly quelling a giant army, she is a guardian of order and justice. However, this fierce warrior suffers from severe face blindness, often mistaking foes for allies, and usually fights alone due to accidental injuries. Despite this, Suo\'er\'s simple heart still yearns for true friendship.',
