      'Profession: Guardian | Attribute: Holy',
      "Introduction: Thor——One of the【Queen's】subordinates, an important pillar of the【Aesir Clan】, and guardian of the【Misty Forest】. She is born with thunder-like tremendous power, wielding the giant hammer【Mjolnir】and the Valkyrie's great shield. She can summon lightning and transform into electricity, with brilliant battle achievements. She once single-handedly pacified giant legions and is a guardian of order and justice. However, this brave warrior suffers from severe face blindness, often mistaking enemies for allies, only able to distinguish family members, and frequently fights alone due to friendly fire incidents. Despite this, the pure-hearted Thor still yearns to have true friends in her heart.",

      "Introduction: One of the commanding officers of the Saffir military, although a high-ranking officer in the army, Thousand Nights is privately the most undisciplined soldier, even more relaxed and casual than comparison, acting somewhat like a slacker. Although appearing approachable and easy-going, Thousand Nights is completely unreliable regarding personal privacy. As long as there's a holiday, they will definitely go to bars continuously, not understanding what daily cleaning up is about, and their purple military uniform and coat have been worn for who knows how long without being washed. Without close friends' reminders and【nagging】, Thousand Nights might become even more sloppy.",

      'Introduction: On a night of dark wind and high moon, you alone sleep in the spacious bed, listening to the sound of clashing from outside. You investigate the source alone, stepping forward barefoot. The cold external ground makes your body shiver, and after experiencing countless disputes, you finally muster the courage to face this inner fear... However, before you is just a string that refuses to break.',

      "Introduction: You came to the private room of Thousand Nights' commander, pushed the door and entered, and saw a figure wearing wine clothes, with disheveled hair, unkempt appearance, purple military uniform, standing on the sofa singing. You habitually helped collect the things scattered on the ground, and the drunk person would also use gestures to continue with you, asking you to accompany them for a drink, using the entire evening's time to accompany them through the most lonely dark night.",
