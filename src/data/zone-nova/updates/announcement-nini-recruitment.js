      "Nini is a member of the BETA special squad and Lili's younger sister. She has a calm personality, exceptional combat intelligence, and gives off an icy vibe—different from her sister. She is not good at expressing her inner thoughts and only cares about the captain and Lili. When around unfamiliar people, she becomes cold and quiet, but when she is alone with the captain, she drops her outward protective shell and shows a playful, coquettish side.",
