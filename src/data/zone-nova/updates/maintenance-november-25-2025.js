      '- Class: Supporter | Attribute: Holy',
      '- Introduction: Her true identity is not human, but rather the legendary magic holy sword worn by Queen Guinevere. After absorbing the queen\'s magic power for many years, this weapon awakened self-consciousness and refused to continue existing as a mere "tool." She thus transformed into human form and defected, becoming the Witch Queen with an independent will.',

      "- Introduction: Morgan with her back to you, a casual bending motion, yet outlining a scene that seems to freeze time. That is a pair of absolutely perfect hips—plump yet firm, under the fitted clothing, presenting a flawless rounded curve, as if the creator's proudest masterpiece. The Witch Queen's perfect figure, even the curves of her beautiful hips seem heaven-carved.",
      '',
      'Just as your gaze is about to be swallowed by that perfect curve, she seems to sense the heated gaze behind her and suddenly turns her head. Her cheeks flushed red, her watery eyes filled with embarrassment, she protests in an almost inaudible voice.',
      '',
      "The blush on the Witch Queen's face adds a few more hazy temptations to her inadvertently exposed charm. The more flustered her explanation, the clearer her natural sensuality becomes. Her mouth says refusal, but in that shy glance back—is it really just simple protest?",

      '',
      "While others keep their distance due to her difficult nature, you alone always respectfully stand by her side, at her beck and call. When bystanders whisper, guessing whether you've been caught by her and forced to endure such treatment, you simply keep your head bowed in submission, saying nothing.",
      '',
      "What they don't know is that every late night spent keeping her warm, every run through the rain just for a sweet treat she casually mentioned, even enduring her cold words and harsh treatment—all of it is for that final moment's reward. When her fingertips inadvertently brush across the back of your hand, or when she lifts those proud bare feet, occasionally revealing her dependence and softness—these are your private treasures to cherish...",
