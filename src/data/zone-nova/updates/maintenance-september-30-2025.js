Whether living creatures, humans, or space creatures, they are all drawn to souls, leaving only corpses behind daily, repeating the same actions without any struggle, emotion, or even facing death. Other forces consider these creatures as [Living Dead], and these [Living Dead] can carry [Nether Lord] Hella's [Dominance Authority: Ruthless Death]. Once touched by them, they will be quickly drained of souls. Therefore, whether Austin or other forces, none dare to invade the corrupted [Death God Realm].",
