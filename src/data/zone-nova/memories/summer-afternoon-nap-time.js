    description: 'This memory card is designed for disaster-class characters, providing scaling offensive power based on enemy count. The base 20% attack increase provides consistent damage enhancement, while the enemy-scaling mechanic (up to 4 stacks of 5% each) rewards disaster units for engaging multiple opponents. At maximum stacks against 4+ enemies, this memory provides a total of 40% attack power increase, making it extremely powerful in multi-enemy encounters and ideal for disaster units who excel at AoE damage.'
