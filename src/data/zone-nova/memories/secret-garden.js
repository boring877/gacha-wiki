    description: 'This memory card perfectly complements Afrodite\'s enhanced ultimate mechanics. The substantial +40% attack boost significantly amplifies her already impressive damage output from both normal attacks and ultimates. The enhanced ultimate synergy effect grants an additional +40% damage boost for 10 seconds when she triggers her enhanced Love and Beauty Waltz, which activates after building up 10 normal attacks. This creates powerful burst windows that synergize perfectly with her Beautiful Kill passive and high-scaling ultimate damage.'
