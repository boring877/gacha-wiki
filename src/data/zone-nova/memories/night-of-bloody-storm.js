    description: 'This memory card perfectly complements Arthur\'s role as a holy DPS powerhouse. The substantial +40% attack boost significantly amplifies his damage output from both normal attacks and ultimates. The unique support synergy effect grants an additional +40% ultimate damage when allies in support positions use their ultimates, creating powerful combo opportunities. This works exceptionally well with Arthur\'s Enhanced Ultimate mode and his passive Royal Dominance stacks, making him a devastating force in team compositions with strong support characters.'
