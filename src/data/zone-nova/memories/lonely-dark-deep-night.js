      "This memory card transforms Chiya into a snowballing powerhouse that grows stronger throughout battle. The +60% critical damage amplifies her already high critical potential from her team skill and awakening effects. The kill stacking mechanic synergizes perfectly with Chiya's burst damage ultimate, allowing her to gain permanent attack power increases that persist throughout the entire battle. Each enemy elimination makes her subsequent critical strikes and ice damage even more devastating.",
