      'This memory card perfectly amplifies Belphegar\'s role as a chaos debuffer and team protector. The +30% debuff application rate ensures his critical rate and critical damage reductions land more consistently, while the 50% enhancement to critical rate reduction makes his "Power of the Blanket" skill devastatingly effective against enemy DPS characters. The team damage reduction trigger provides additional defensive support, turning Belphegar into both an offensive disruptor and defensive anchor for the team.',
