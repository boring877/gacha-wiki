  // Character Synergy

    description:
      "This memory card perfectly complements Freye's role as a chaos debuffer specialist. The substantial +40% attack boost significantly amplifies her damage output from all abilities. The unique Fate Bind mechanic synergizes exceptionally well with her Enhanced Ultimate's large black hole, as the AOE damage can quickly stack Fate Bind on multiple enemies. This creates a powerful debuff spiral where enemies take progressively more damage as stacks accumulate, making Freye devastating in prolonged encounters and team compositions focused on sustained damage amplification.",
