    description: 'This memory card is perfectly designed around Artemis\'s low-HP combat philosophy. The base +40% attack power provides a solid damage foundation, while the conditional +40% damage below 50% HP synergizes perfectly with Artemis\'s passive ability that grants +60% attack power as additional wind damage when below 50% HP. When combined with her ultimate\'s HP consumption mechanic, this memory allows Artemis to consistently operate in the danger zone where both effects activate, creating explosive damage potential.'
