    description: 'This memory card perfectly complements Greed Mammon\'s enhanced ultimate mechanics by providing consistent damage boosts through team coordination. Since Greed Mammon can activate his enhanced ultimate after allies use their ultimates, this memory creates a powerful synergy loop - support allies trigger both his enhanced ultimate availability AND the 60% damage boost simultaneously. This turns him into a devastating follow-up damage dealer who capitalizes on team ultimate chains for maximum chaos damage output.'
