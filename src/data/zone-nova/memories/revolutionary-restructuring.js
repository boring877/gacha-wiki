    description:
      "This memory card enhances Cleopatra's persistent damage strategy by adding a new layer of chaos damage over time. The +40% attack power amplifies both her direct damage and all her persistent damage effects. The [Infiltration] effect works perfectly with her kit - every skill use now applies both [Deception] and [Infiltration], creating multiple damage-over-time effects that stack. This synergizes excellently with her ultimate's persistent damage scaling and her passive [Whisper] consumption mechanics.",
