      "This memory card is tailor-made for Hera's chaos damage and sustained damage playstyle. The +40% attack power amplifies her already impressive sword-based damage output, while the conditional +40% damage against targets with sustained damage effects synergizes perfectly with her [Virtual] debuff application from her passive. Since Hera can consistently apply [Virtual] stacks through her sword attacks and ultimate, this memory ensures she deals devastating damage to marked targets, making her exceptionally effective against both single targets and groups.",
