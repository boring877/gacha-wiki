      id: 2,
      question: 'What are the summon rates for characters vs memories?',
      answer:
        'Character Summons: SSR 0.6% base (1.6% effective), SR 6% total. Memory Summons: SSR 0.8% base (1.87% effective), SR 9.1% total. Memory summons have higher rates but focus on memories instead of characters.',
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: 'How does the pity system work for each summon type?',
      answer:
        'Character Summons: 90-pull guarantee for SSR characters, 10-pull for SR. Memory Summons: 80-pull guarantee for SSR memories, 10-pull for SR memories. Each system has independent pity counters.',
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "What's the difference between Character and Memory rate-ups?",
      answer:
        'Character rate-ups have 50% chance for featured SSR/SR characters. Memory rate-ups have 75% chance for featured SSR/SR memories. Memory banners have higher rate-up percentages.',

    },
    {
      id: 7,
      question: 'Can I get characters from Memory Summons?',
      answer:
        'Yes, Memory Summons can give SR characters (4.55% rate) along with memories. However, for SSR characters, you must use Character Summons as Memory Summons only give SSR memories.',
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      question: 'Is rerolling worth it for new players?',
      answer:
        'Yes, reroll on Character Summons to get powerful SSR characters. Memory Summons are secondary - focus on getting strong characters first, then worry about memories later.',
    },
    {
      id: 9,
      question: 'How do I get the rainbow cube and regular cube?',
      answer:

    },
    {
      id: 10,
      question: 'Is this game friendly with summons?',
      answer:
        'They are quite good with giving cubes and gems, but they are not as good as BD2. In 1 month you can get a featured banner, but not the memory banner.',
    },
    {
      id: 11,
      question: 'Does the premium banner go to the regular banner?',
      answer: 'The premium banner only stays for 2 weeks and does not go to the regular banner.',
