        <p>A lot of players try to use Tanks early in the game to absorb hits. They keep dying early and want someone tanky enough to keep the team alive. What they don't realize is that you can use Festive Attire Estrirel to spam her healing ultimate without ever needing a tank.</p>

        <h2>Festive Attire Estrirel - The Infinite Healer</h2>
        <p>Festive Attire Estrirel has high MP Charge, and once you upgrade your Annihilation Grenade weapon to higher levels, the MP Charge improves even further - letting you ultimate much faster.</p>

        <h2>Understanding MP Charge</h2>
        <p>MP Charge means that when you use your skills, you gain 150 MP. The total MP needed to activate your ultimate is 500. With this setup, you'll be able to activate your ultimate every few seconds in each fight, making tanks far less important.</p>

        <h2>Action Speed Matters</h2>
        <p>The game uses Action Speed to determine how quickly you can activate your skills. There are different Action Speed categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Slow</li>
          <li>Slightly Slow</li>
          <li>Normal</li>
          <li>Slightly Fast</li>
          <li>Fast</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Perfect Pairing: Liesel</h2>
        <p>Pairing Festive Attire Estrirel with Liesel helps with both MP generation and Action Speed. Once these two units are paired together and built properly, you won't need a tank at all.</p>
        <p>Liesel also needs her Annihilation Staff upgraded enough to boost her MP Charge. Her Action Speed is Normal.</p>

        <h2>The Result</h2>
        <p>Both units need sufficient weapon upgrades to reach enough MP Charge so you can spam both of their ultimates. This creates a cycle of constant healing and MP generation - no tank required, just good damage dealers to clear content fast!</p>

        <h2>Spending Priority</h2>

        <h3>1. 25% OFF Coupon (Top Priority)</h3>
        <p>Grab this first. The discount value is significant and you can only get one.</p>

        <h3>2. Memory Crystal</h3>
        <p>At only 2 emblems each with a limit of 100, this is excellent value. Prioritize these after the discount coupon.</p>

        <h3>3. Ancient Artifact Coin or Regol Coin</h3>
        <p>Both cost very little and provide solid value. Ancient Artifact Coins cost 2 emblems each, while Regol Coins give you 10,000 coins for just 1 emblem.</p>

        <h3>4. ★5 Accessory Box, Summon Ticket, SSR Paladin's Bond</h3>
        <p>These are fine to pick up if you have spare emblems.</p>

        <h3>5. Too Expensive - Skip These</h3>
        <p>The following items cost too much for what they offer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Extermination Spear</li>
          <li>Extermination Spear Exclusive Limit Break Material</li>
          <li>Extermination Staff</li>
          <li>Extermination Staff Exclusive Limit Break Material</li>
          <li>Raid Battle Ticket Box</li>
