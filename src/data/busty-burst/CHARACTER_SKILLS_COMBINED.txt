BUSTY FANTASY BURST - SELECTED CHARACTER SKILLS (WITH ACTUAL VALUES)
================================================================================

BUFF REFERENCE:
- Formula: Base + (Growth × Character Level)
- Physical/Magic ATK: +X% +Y (grow: +Z)  →  +X% +(Y + Z×Lv)
- Physical/Magic DEF: +X% +Y (grow: +Z)  →  +X% +(Y + Z×Lv)
- Accuracy/Block: +Y (grow: +Z)  →  +(Y + Z×Lv)
- Action Speed: +X% (no growth)
- Crit Rate: +Y (grow: +Z)  →  +(Y + Z×Lv)  (buff text says "Crit Damage" but adds to rate)
- [Lv100: ...] shows calculated values at max level (Base + Growth×100)

HEALING FORMULA:
- Heal = (Healing Power × Scale) + Base + (Growth × Level)
- Format: (Healing Power × X) + Base (+Growth/lv)

DAMAGE FORMULA:
- Skill Raw Damage = (ATK × Scale%) + Base + (Growth × Level)
- Format: [X% ATK + Base (+Growth/lv)]
- Example: [350% ATK + 150 (+20/lv)] at Level 50 with 1000 ATK:
  Raw Damage = (1000 × 3.5) + 150 + (20 × 50) = 3500 + 150 + 1000 = 4650
- Final Damage = Raw Damage reduced by target's DEF (exact formula unknown - hardcoded in game)
- Critical Hit = Final Damage × Crit Damage Multiplier (fixed value, hardcoded in game)
- Physical damage uses ATK stat, reduced by Physical DEF
- Magic damage uses MATK stat, reduced by Magic DEF

STAT EXPLANATIONS:
- Physical Crit: CRIT RATE for physical attacks (chance to crit, varies: 22-391)
- Magic Crit: CRIT RATE for magic attacks (chance to crit, varies: 22-234)
- Crit +X (from buffs): Adds +X to Physical/Magic Crit Rate
  Note: Crit DAMAGE multiplier is a fixed value (hardcoded in game engine)
- Accuracy: Increases chance to hit. Higher = more likely to hit enemies with high Block
- Block: Reduces chance to be hit. Higher = more likely to dodge attacks
- Action Speed +X%+Y: Increases attack/skill speed. +X% is percentage, +Y is flat bonus
- Shield -X% (N hits): Reduces incoming damage by X% for N hits before breaking
- Debuff Resistance +X%: Reduces chance to be affected by debuffs by X%
- Healing Amount +X%: Increases healing output by X% (for healers)
- Healing Received +X%: Increases healing received by X% (for targets)
- Skill Damage +X%: Increases damage dealt by skills by X%
- Ultimate Damage +X%: Increases damage dealt by ultimate skill by X%
- Type ATK +X% (Fire/Wind/etc): Increases damage against that element type
- Type DEF -X% (Fire/Wind/etc): Reduces target's resistance to that element
