  // Character Story
  story:
    'At the highest point of the Noctis Nebula world lies the heart of the ancient, exalted Kingdom of Platinum Bough, where the slumbering Sorceress Queen resides. This Elven Queen, whose transcendent power once caused even the spirits to tremble, made a pact: the spirits would watch over all Highland Elves, and in return, she would refrain from interfering in worldly matters, pledging herself to an eternal slumber. All humans and elves alike have long revered this powerful being, calling her the "Eternal Queen."\n\nHowever, when the Rift brought about an age of destruction, the spirits fled from the threat, breaking their golden pact. This caused the queen to awaken. She was horrified to find the Kingdom of Platinum Bough in ruins, and enraged at the spirits for breaking their vow. Determined to protect her people herself, she tore through space with her immense power, opening a passage to Earth—a relatively nearby and intact world—and led her people there. Though the effort took a heavy toll on her strength, the queen felt satisfaction in having guided her people to safety.\n\nNow, as she rests to regain her power, her fury against the Rift remains strong. It won\'t be long before she returns to the battlefield, ready to fight once again.',
