  // Character Story
  story:
    "Kim Ga-young was an ordinary girl who lived her life as naturally as water flows. Though her academic performance was always outstanding, she simply followed what others told her to do, eventually getting into a prestigious university. One day, by chance, she witnessed Yeon Chae-young commanding a Rift siteâ€”a scene that left a deep impression on her, especially seeing a woman take charge so confidently. It was a defining moment for Ga-young: she had found her role model. Inspired by Yeon Chae-young, she decided that she wanted to become an impressive woman like her, and immediately began studying for the civil service examination. Given her talent for studying, she passed the exam with ease and applied to become an agent under Yeon Chae-young's lead. Though people around her expressed concerns, she remained determined for the first time in her life. Although she couldn't become a dedicated agent to the Human God like Yeon Chae-young, she managed to become a scout that supports them.",
