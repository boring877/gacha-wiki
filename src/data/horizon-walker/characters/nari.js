  // Story
  story: `Nari's family, the Taeha family, had long served as vassals to the Daeyeon family. Nari herself always believed that she would serve the Daeyeon family as well, and it was decided that she would specifically serve Juha, a member of the Daeyeon family. Nari accompanied Juha as part of the delegation sent to Earth, ensuring Juha's safe arrival. Fortunately, Nari was a true soldierâ€”skilled in maintaining a poker face and rarely showing her emotions. She thought of Juha, whose words often contradicted her actions, as an adorable mistress and resolved to assist her as much as possible. Especially after discovering Juha's interest in the Human Sovereign, she decided to help her mistress pursue her feelings, believing that love would greatly contribute to Juha's emotional growth. Nari began studying Earthlings' ways of love, and, in order to put that knowledge to use, she decided to become a Vanguard of the Human Sovereign.`,
