  // Character Story
  story:
    "Laguna Island, far removed from the continent, had long been a place of exploitation. In such a place, Pantheri emerged like a comet, rescuing the common peopleâ€”a righteous outlaw. Calling herself a freebooter or hero, Pantheri demonstrated incredible swordsmanship alone, representing the people in trial by combat or assassinating corrupt nobles, among other daring deeds. In truth, she was Elena, the daughter of the viceroy of Laguna, and when that fact became known, she had no choice but to flee to the Imperial mainland. After the Rift Crisis, Pantheri arrived on Earth and discovered that there were also suffering people here, even in the outskirts. Moreover, the exploitation on Earth was far more subtle and systematic, requiring her to be even more cautious. It was Yeon Chae-young of the Bureau of Rift Management who sought her out. Yeon Chae-young showed Pantheri records from the past and explained that the hardships these people endured ultimately stemmed from the Rifts. She convinced Pantheri that the real enemy was the monsters of the Rift. Pantheri accepted Yeon Chae-young's words and decided to fight as a Vanguard to make this world a better place.",
