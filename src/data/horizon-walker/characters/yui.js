  // Character Story
  story:
    "Matsumoto Yui grew up in a peaceful, ordinary home—surrounded by warmth, stability, and love. For as long as she could remember, her dream had been simple: to one day build a quiet, happy family of her own. But fate had other plans. Born with a rare psionic gift, Yui couldn't remain in the background for long. As the Rift Crisis worsened, her abilities made her a natural fit for the Bureau of Rift Management. She rose quickly through the ranks as an Esper agent of Discover, carrying out her duties with calm precision and quiet excellence. Yet her talent came at a price. Her success often went unacknowledged—her accomplishments taken by those above her. And then came the worst of them: Secretary So Joo-hee. Under her, Yui was left to manage the Intelligence Division nearly alone. Even so, she endured. Now, assigned to the command of the Human God—someone unlike any superior she's ever known—Yui is slowly beginning to believe in something more. That maybe her strength doesn't have to come at the cost of isolation. That maybe, in this strange new world... her long-held dream is no longer out of reach.",
