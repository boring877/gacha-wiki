  // Character Story
  story:
    'Erneste, born the daughter of the Imperial Mercenary Commander, took over the mercenary company at a young age when her father could no longer lead. Unfortunately, during one of her missions, she was cursed by a sorcerer, compelled to utter vile words regardless of the situation. Not long after, this curse caused a breakdown in her relationship with her subordinatesâ€”the mercenaries lost trust in her as Erneste\'s words turned increasingly spiteful. Eventually, she was abandoned by her own men. Fortunately, thanks to the kindness of Maximilia, she managed to escape safely to Earth during the Great Escape. However, her notorious reputation made it hard for anyone to accept her. That was when Yeon Chae-young, who had heard of her talent, approached her, offering a chance to put her skills to use for the Federation. Erneste accepted the offer.',
