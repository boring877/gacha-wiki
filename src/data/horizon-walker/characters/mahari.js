  // Character Story
  story:
    "Mahari is a new recruit of the 4th Legion, famous for capturing and executing the gladiator-skyrogue Kalakul. Born into a deeply traditional military family, she completed her training with excellent marks, earning her placement in the 4th Legion. Mahari herself dreamed of capturing a notorious pirate and thereby contributing to the Republic's honor and glory. However, when the Rift opened and the 4th Legion attempted to escape to avoid destruction, they were suddenly ambushed by Kesak skyrogues. At the time, there was an unspoken agreement that Lamora and Kesak would no longer engage in conflict, leaving the 4th Legion unprepared to deal with both the Rift and the skyrogues. The legion was overwhelmed, most of its members perished, and the survivors scattered in disarray. Mahari survived only thanks to the sacrifices and care of her senior comrades, but was ultimately left alone. After arriving on Earth, she officially applied for refugee status, harboring a desire to avenge herself against Kesak and resume the honorable path of a soldier.",
