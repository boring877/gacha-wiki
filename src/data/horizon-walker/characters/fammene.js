  // Character Story
  story:
    "Fammene, one of the Windweavers of the Windpetal Tower, was known from childhood for her beauty and her colorful romances. At the young age of nineteen, she married one of the scions of the Grand Duke of Tranel's family. Unfortunately for Fammene, her husband mysteriously died one night, and she was accused of causing his death during their conjugal relations, leading to her confinement in a convent. To make matters worse, the rumors from her single days painted her as a debauched woman, resulting in significant persecution. In an unfortunate turn of events that worked to her advantage, the Rift Crisis allowed her to escape from the convent.\\n\\nShe later joined Crown Princess Maximilia, distinguishing herself as an outstanding Wind Guide and playing a key role in ensuring their safe arrival on Earth. She hoped to continue her work on Earth, but soon after, the arrival of people from Tranel once again complicated her situation. Those from Tranel who despised her spread malicious rumors, and with the princess—her primary protector—absent due to diplomatic duties in Seoul, she found herself isolated once again, caught between those who scorned her and those who leered at her. Seeking to escape the harsh refugee community, she has applied to become a Vanguard.",
