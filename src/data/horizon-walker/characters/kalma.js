  // Character Story
  story:
    "Once named heir to the Storm Clan of the Kesak, Kalma showed remarkable brilliance from an early age. She mastered the clan's treasured Storm Cell with ease, and all believed she was destined for greatness. But when the Rift annihilated her people, leaving her the sole survivor, she appeared on Earth with a new dream—no longer to be the Kesak's greatest raider, but to become president of the Federation. Now serving as a Vanguard under the Human God, Kalma sees this as the perfect chance to rise as a political powerhouse. With unshakable ambition, she marches forward, determined to claim the presidency and lead the charge against the Rift.",
