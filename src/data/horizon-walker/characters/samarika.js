  // Character Story
  story: `For Samarika, her older sister Kalina was a figure of both love and hatred. This sentiment had taken root when she was very young, as Kalina, under the pretext of training her, used all of the renowned swamp elf hero Elkalin's combat techniques on her. Naturally, she was nothing more than a sparring target for Kalina, and her resentment only grew. The tipping point came when Kalina applied for and secured the position of Swamp Ranger officer that Samarika had set her eyes on. To Samarika, who dreamed of living independently from Kalina, this was a bolt from the blue. Having experienced multiple conflicts over time, Samarika no longer wanted to be subordinate to her sister after moving to Earth. Inspired by her insights from the East Asian Federation, she left her sister's vigilante group and established her own, gaining quite a reputation under the name "Hanseong Owls."`,
