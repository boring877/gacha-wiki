  // Character Story
  story:
    'The Orke, a race of mercenaries across the universe, are particularly fond of firearms, but some of them, those who awaken their mental abilities, replace bullets and grenades with their own mental energy. These individuals are called "shamans," and Juha of the prestigious Daeyeon family is one of the most talented among them. Born into the renowned Daeyeon family, Juha joined her clan\'s mercenary business as soon as she turned twenty. During battle, she awakened as a shaman, gaining the ability to channel her mental energy through her gun. However, this wasn\'t entirely a good thing for Juha. Her mental energy was so powerful that she began to lose control, and her thoughts started to become audible to those around her. Fortunately, those in her vicinity kept this fact from her, considering her high status, and, taking the political ramifications into account, they decided to send her off-world for training until she could master her abilities and suppress her thoughts. Not knowing the real reason, Juha was resentful about being suddenly dispatched to Earth, almost like an exile, but she is determined to prove her worth as a capable mercenary. She hopes to find the Human Gods, the combat leaders of Earth, and offer the combat prowess of herself and her subordinates.',
