  // Character Story
  story:
    "In Tranel, learning the magic of frost is an extremely dangerous endeavor. Those who master it are often seen as people who halt the natural flow, and thus face religious and social suspicion, even if they manage to attain noble titles—often being talked about behind their backs. For this reason, most Frostmancers are orphans who begin learning frost magic from a very young age. Yvonna was one of these orphans. She learned various dangerous frost spells as a child and was selected as an officer in charge of fleet attacks under Vlissing's command. In the process, she learned to act kindly towards everyone in order not to appear dangerous, and she realized that controlling her emotions allowed her to avoid some of the scrutiny. As a result, she learned to greet others with a smile, almost like a doll. During the process of escaping from Tranel to Earth, she played a significant role, earning the trust of many people, and now, she has become able to work openly in the light.",
