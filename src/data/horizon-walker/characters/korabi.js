  // Character Story
  story:
    'From childhood, Korabi was timid—an unforgivable flaw among the brutish Kesak. Because of this, she was ostracized by her kin, spending most of her time on the fringes of ruined sites. One day, a fatal fall nearly killed her. She was saved by an ancient relic mask of her ancestors, which granted her the ability to manipulate blood. This power drastically boosted her intelligence, but also widened the rift between her and the rest of the Kesak. Eventually, she left Bel-Lamori alone, catching the eye of the Rift Nations. She became a Vanguard under the Human God, carrying a faint hope that perhaps she might one day change her foolish kin.',
