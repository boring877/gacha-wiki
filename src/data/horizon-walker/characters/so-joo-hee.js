  // Character Story
  story:
    "So Joo-hee is the daughter of the Vice Minister of the Interior, which oversees the Bureau of Rift Management, and her family has long been celebrated as a prestigious line of bureaucrats. However, Joo-hee herself didn't quite live up to the family's standards. Unable to join one of the older, more established departments, she was instead hired as a special recruit for the Dimension Immigration Department of the Bureau of Rift Management, which was severely understaffed. Later, she managed to transfer to the Intelligence Department, a core division, which allowed her to maintain the title of an elite bureaucrat. This series of events, however, significantly hurt her self-esteem and contributed to her impulsive and attention-seeking personality. To make matters worse, her father, concerned about the family's reputation, severely restricted her romantic relationships, which only heightened her yearning for freedom. Given these circumstances, it was almost inevitable that she would clash with Yeon Chae-young, who was regarded as the top elite of the Bureau of Rift Management, and soon enough, the two developed a notorious rivalry. Though she is often dismissed as an incompetent nepotism hire, some believe that she has untapped potential.",
