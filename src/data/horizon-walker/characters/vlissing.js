  // Character Story
  story:
    'In the Tranel Republic, famous for its navigation, the Flow Guardians who guide the ships are the most important mages in the republic. They direct waterways and at times even create currents directly. Some Flowmancers possess the ability to manipulate the flow within the body to heal wounds. These individuals learn the art of fluid manipulation, earning them noble status and significant influence in society. Among these Flow Guardians, the artisan maiden of the flow, Vlissing, is renowned for her grace and majesty. Despite being human, she received the blessing of the flow and does not age, making her radiant beauty and her rejection of countless marriage proposals from noblemen famous. She is arrogant toward everyone, but due to her immense control over the power of the flow, few are willing to cross her. After leading the people of Tranel to Earth with her powers, she dispatched Flow Guardians to various locations related to water. While she is regarded as an important figure even in Neo Seoul, Vlissing still seeks to elevate her name further, craving greater reverence and admiration.',
