Yet only today, inhabiting the knight's form within Genevieve's memories, do I truly witness the genesis of this grand conspiracy.\n\nThe princess's day unfolds like an endless battlefield—dawn breaks with equestrian drills, midday is spent on tactical studies, and twilight brings political lessons. Every merciless hour of this regimen serves one sacred purpose: the salvation of Carrelle lands devoured by the flames of war.\n\nIn political class, the atmosphere thickens to a suffocating weight as the bishop delivers his calculated torment: 'Your Highness, envision the borders erupting in warfare. Would you levy crushing taxes upon your people to fund our armies, condemning millions to starvation? Or would you empty the royal granaries to feed the masses while watching the Kingdom crumble to ash? As future Lord, what is your choice?'\n\nThe realization strikes like lightning—this is Carrelle family's merciless probe of its heir. I surge to my feet, steel singing as my blade finds the bishop's throat, declaring his crimes of 'defiance against the sovereign and sedition among the people.' Death has never touched him so intimately. His face drains to bone-white terror.\n\n'Enough.' Genevieve's touch guides my sword aside with gentle authority, her gaze turning toward the bishop with eyes that dance with dark amusement: 'Sir, the burden you and Father bear is not lost on me. In these precarious times, we all must navigate our own treacherous paths and impossible choices.'\n\nIn that crystalline moment, I glimpse the mastermind's satisfaction as she watches her carefully placed pieces align upon the board.",

When she and countless Brennholts were consumed by fire, their purpose was not to destroy the Divine Body, but to smother the Calamity 'Flames of War'—a karmic fire that burned a thousandfold more fiercely than any earthly flame.\n\nNow, on the eve of the sacrificial rite, I could feel the frenzy and wild vigor of the flames of Calamity with crystalline clarity. The Divine Body was spending its waning energy in desperate struggle, fighting to contain and suppress the very essence of Calamity writhing within its core. What stratagem had Genevieve prepared for this moment?\n\nFirelight flickered across Genevieve's features as she drew an ancient wheel from the folds of her robes. Intricate patterns were carved deep into its bronze surface. If memory served, this was the sacred heirloom passed down through generations of the Alita family.",

I lunged forward, seizing one of the slaves by the shoulder, desperate to warn him—this was no trial leading to liberation, and they were marching to their deaths as sacrificial offerings.\n\nThe slave turned slowly, and in his gaze I found not terror, but a resolve unlike anything I had ever witnessed—the transcendent serenity that belongs only to those who embrace their fate willingly. 'I know.' he said simply.\n\nHe spoke of his willingness to become a sacrifice, for Princess Genevieve would guide them all to shatter the cursed destiny of the Carrelle family. Not in this age, but in the time yet to come.\n\nAt last, comprehension flooded through me. I understood Genevieve's gambit to break the deadlock.\n\nI understood why she had bidden me wait in this place—the 'Queen' would lead all her 'pawns' to flow against the current of a fated future, reshaping the present.",
